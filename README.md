# _cmd

## What is this?

This is sort of a command-line but all commands are internal & pre-defined. They're registerable with a single command which asks for their typeable name, internal name,
lambda (to execute on typed command) & a description of the command. 

## How to use? 

This is not a library, it's an application. Therefore, if you want to edit &or implement this, you'll need to edit it for your needs.

## The point

There isn't, I made this while bored and think it's cool.
