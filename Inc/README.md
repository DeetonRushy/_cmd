## What is this? 

These are things that aren't an exclusive part of _cmd and can be used externally. The API & arguement parser are in here as they aren't essencial for the project. :heart:

## Arguements

This is just a simple command line arguement 'parser'. It doesn't really parse anything, just checks for keywords & sets a referenced bool.

## Dictionary (un-finished)

This WILL be an alternative to native mscorblib IDictionarys & Dictionarys. Why? Having our own dictionary allows us to add anything we like to it when needed.

## Logging

Small logging class. This appends text to a file & sorts logging directory information etc.

## PluginAPI

The API for creating plugins for **_cmd**_. This is still under development and is unstable.

There is now support for native executable plugins, they are registered as internal commands when placed in plugins/exec.
